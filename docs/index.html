            approaches and execution methods, resource estimates, people and organizations involved, and other relevant

                <p>The focus of the project description is put on creating a clear and correct understanding of the project in minds of the people and organizations involved in the planning and development process. The project team (which is supposed to do the project) uses the document to get a general idea of what amount of work and under what requirements is planned for completion. The senior management team regards the project description as the key source of preliminary information necessary for strategic planning and development.</p>
